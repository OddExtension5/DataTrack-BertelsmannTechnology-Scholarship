Businesses need to be able to track how they are performing on key goals or objectives - whether they are growing number of customers, bringing down their costs, increasing revenue on an ongoing basis, and myriad others. 

**Key Performance Indicators or KPIs** are how they measure their success on each of their key business objectives.

## Which KPI to use?

The decision regarding which KPI a business analyst should use depends on several factors, including which industry or domain they are working in, which business function they are focusing on, and the type of data they have available to them.

## Asking Data Questions

The KPIs you use will be determined by the questions you need to ask. As a business analyst, you are tasked with gathering the appropriate data to help solve business problems. To get to that solution, you will need to:

+ Identify what needs to change
+ Communicate this change to stakeholders in clear manageable chunks of data

## How to Ask the Questions
There are several steps needed to determine the questions to askâ€”

1. Identify the business goal and objectives.
2. Narrow down the type of data needed to answer questions.
3. Identify the KPIs that will be useful to show whether you are making progress on your business goal.
4. Conduct the data analysis using the KPIs and use visualizations as part of the analysis.
5. Provide recommendations and findings based on the completed data analysis.
6. Create succinct and visual presentations for the stakeholders.
